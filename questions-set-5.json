With discrimination destroyed, one perishes. So while attachment is the root, it is anger that directly causes clouding of judgment."

    "description": "This comes from the classification of Chitta Bhūmis in Yoga psychology. 1. Mūḍha Chitta → Known as the \"donkey mind\" because it is dull, inert, ignorant, and driven only by tamas (darkness/inertia). It cannot discriminate between right and wrong. 2. Kṣipta Chitta → Restless, distracted (rajasic). 3. Vikṣipta Chitta → Occasionally steady, but easily distracted. 4. Ekāgra Chitta → One-pointed mind, concentrated. 5. Niruddha Chitta → Fully restrained, leading to Samadhi."
