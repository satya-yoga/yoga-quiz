Alabdha-bhūmikatva (अलब्धभूमिकत्व) literally = failure (alabdha) to obtain (labh) the stage/ground (bhūmika). It means inability to attain the next stage of practice → failing to gain a firm footing in Yoga progress. Failing to maintain a firm ground → Anavasthitatva; Failing to have mental clarity → closer to Bhranti-darshana or distraction."
